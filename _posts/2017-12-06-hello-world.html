        <h2 class="mb-5">You don't know me, but you might know my open source project <a href="https://startbootstrap.com">Start Bootstrap</a>.</h2>
        <p>At the point of writing this, I've been a web designer for over nine years. It sounds crazy saying it out loud. Now if you've stumbled upon this post, you probably got here due to my affiliation with Start Bootstrap, an open source project that I created and still manage to this day. Regardless of how you ended up here, welcome!</p>
        <p>Now I am not a great blogger, or writer for that matter, but this is my humble attempt at changing that. Friends and acquaintances have been telling me for the past few years that I should start sharing my thoughts and writing from time to time, so here I am after reading one too many articles about motivation and making things happen.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">I'm in uncharted territory at this point, and I am not sure whether my ideas are correct or even worth sharing, but I am hoping that some of you out there might get some value out of what I end up doing here, that's how Start Bootstrap was created after all and it's been more successful than I ever could have imagined.</p>
        <h2 class="mb-5">This site was coded live for your viewing pleasure.</h2>
        <p>Speaking of uncharted territory, I recently started streaming some of my code sessions on Twitch. This website was actually developed in front of a live audience - mostly - and is build with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and running on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> (some of my most frequently used tools). Streaming has been a great way for me to get in touch with Start Bootstrap users, and the journey is just beginning.</p>
        <p>You can follow the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/startbootstrap">Start Bootstrap channel on Twitch</a> if you want to see how I set up projects and design websites, or if you have questions for me about Start Bootstrap or anything else front-end development related. I'm not claiming to be a master of all things web development, but I guess I know a thing or two - enough to make the stream worth watching.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">I work from home, you see, so it helps a lot to have some folks to talk to during work hours on certain days of the week - mainly Tuesday and Thursday from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM EST. Is it still a shameless plug if it's on my own blog?</p>
        <h2 class="mb-5">Anyways...</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website. Keep an eye out for more, and I'll keep myself honest about sharing some thoughts with you all. Until next time!</p>
